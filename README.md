The research described in this thesis aims to apply a novel set of technical resources to visualization in the geosciences. It draws on the immense potential of the human user for feature detection through connecting scientific data formats to computer graphics technologies. The software applications written in response to this opportunity therefore make strong use of interactivity in the reconnaissance exploration of example datasets. Throughout the research, a commitment to a well-posed visual display is developed, respecting underlying data values through the managed use of color and other graphic variables.
